# ToulisThesis
 This repository contains the app developed during my diploma thesis in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering of University of Patras.
 The goal of the app is to mainly showcase technologies such as React Native as a tool for mobile development. The app's function is to provide interaction between the user and spaces of cultural importance.

 In order to run the app on your local machine, some steps need to be followed in order to complete the setup. 

 The app is focused on an android version, so Android Studio is needed to run the app on a simulated device. Following the instructions in the link provided under the React Native CLI Quickstart, you can complete the setup and launch the app in a virtual android device: https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup
